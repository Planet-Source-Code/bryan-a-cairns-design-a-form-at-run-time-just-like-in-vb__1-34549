Design a Form at Run Time just like in VB!

With this usercontrol you can easily resize and move controls at runtime. First click a control to select it. Then click and drag a "gripper" to resize. Or right click a "gripper" to move the control, right click again to finish moving.

This usercontrol automatically sizes and positions to the control you select. Also this usercontrol will automatically add and remove itself to a control container (like a picture box) as needed.
